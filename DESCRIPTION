Description: SimBindProfiles identifies common and unique binding regions in genome tiling array data. 
	This package does not rely on peak calling, but directly compares binding profiles 
	processed on the same array platform. It implements a simple threshold approach, 
	thus allowing retrieval of commonly and differentially bound regions between 
	datasets as well as events of compensation and increased binding.
